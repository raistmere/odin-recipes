            <ol>
                <li>
                    Put your chicken in a pot with water and start boiling till it's complete.
                    Then go ahead and shred all the chicken and leave it in a bowl.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After the chicken is complete, go ahead and prepare a pan with oil for light frying.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When the oil is hot enough, go ahead and dip each tortilla one at a time into the oil. Let it fry for 10 seconds on each side. 
                    Once all the tortillas are done frying go ahead and get a sauce pan ready.
                </li>
                <li>
                    With the sauce pan, pour the La Palma Enchilada Red Sauce into the pan. Let the sauce boil then simmer.Get a glass cooking pan to place the 
                    tortillas into.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now dip one tortilla into the sauce and place it into the glass pan. Grab cheese and put it in the middle of the tortilla along with pieces of shredded chicken and onions.
                    After that you roll the tortilla up to form a perfect seal. You repeat this untill all tortillas are done and in the pan. Don't be afraid of fitting them tight and layering 
                    them ontop of each other.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After you got them in, place the glass pan in the oven with foil as a lid. Let it sit in the oven at 350F for 45 minutes or until all the cheese is melted.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once the 45 minutes are over, take it out and get ready to eat some delicious enchiladas.Enjoy!
