            <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Put your chicken in a pot with water and start boiling till it's complete.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After the chicken is complete, go ahead and put 4 cups of the chicken broth left over 
                    into a measuring cup.
                </li>
                <li>
                    With a new pot, pour the chicken broth, Doña Maria mole sauce, peanut butter and chocolate into the pot.
                    Let all the ingredient meld together and make sure the chocolate is melted! Once everything looks great,
                    bring the sauce to a simmer and get ready for the next part.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the boiled chicken into the mole pot and let that simmer for 15 minutes or until you feel that both chicken 
                    and mole are nice and blended.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now it's time to grab a plate! This dish pairs great with mexican rice and beans. Go ahead and dig into the 
                    pot for some mole chicken.
                </li>
                <li>
                    And you are all done, enjoy your chicken mole!
                </li>
